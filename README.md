# dayPlanner
The goal of this project was to create a planner that was time blocks from 9 am to 5 pm. 
The time blocks would change color depending on if they were in the past, present, or future. 
The user can input a task into each time block, click the save button, and if they refresh the page, their input will
still be saved there.
